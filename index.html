        <h2>What is 'भाव'?</h2>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>The word "भाव" is derived from the 'Samskrita' धातु (root word) 'भू' with the घञ्. This भू is listed in धातुपाठ three times. One in भ्वादिगण and the other two in चुरादिगण. However, Panini did not explicitly mention the meaning of the धातुs. However, later commentators discussed the meanings of all धातु (dhātu) terms from धातुपाठ (dhātupāṭha). Well-known and widely spread meanings are mentioned. Other meanings also would be accepted in numerous instances. For the present 'धातु'—'भू'—three meanings are given: 'सत्ता,' 'अवकल्कनम्,' and 'प्राप्ति,' respectively.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, the वाचस्पत्यं mentioned around 20 meanings for the word "भाव". Such as "species," "existence," "intention," "state," "condition of being," "innate property," "disposition," "nature," "meaning," and "mind." "Atman," etc.</p>
            <p>Several Shastras go into deeper observations about the term "भाव" and its meanings as well. At times, they are actually interconnected.</p>
            <p>When you observe this world, you would come to one conclusion: this world is nothing but "a group of species/existence/intention/state/elements".</p>
            <p>भाव, the 'intention' is the core for everything in the universe. All creatures try their best to express their intention effectively as per their organ faculty.</p>
            <p>To express these भावs, one should have the effective and compatible mortal body, i.e., पाञ्चभौतिकशरीरम्. Each of the पञ्चमहाभूत plays a significant role in expressing भाव.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, it is impossible to express the entire भाव, though there are so many ways. Sometimes, though, it is expressed fully from the one side; it is very difficult to decode it. According to the capabilities of the organ faculty, and experiences, one could express his 'भाव.' The Shastras, including Saankhya, Vedaanta, Yoga, Vyaakarana, Miimaamsa, Sangiita, Nirukta, Agama, and so on, discussed this 'Intention' in a more elaborative way in all dynamic ways.</p>
            <p>The core concept of 'भाव' i.e., 'intention,' is fundamental to everything in the universe. Ancient Indian thought recognized that these expressions are not isolated but rather complementary, forming a holistic system for conveying inner feelings and dispositions.</p>
            <p>To express these भावs, one should have the effective and compatible mortal body, i.e., पाञ्चभौतिकशरीरम्. Each of the पञ्चमहाभूत plays a significant role in expressing भाव. भावs (intentions) can be manifested or expressed in the following ways:</p>
