              <p>Gesture encompasses the physical movements and visual signals employed to convey 'भाव'.</p>
              <p><strong>Systematic Movements (like Dance):</strong> ): Highly codified movements, such as those found in classical Indian dance, are meticulously choreographed to express specific emotions, narratives, and philosophical ideas.</p>
              <p>The Natyashastra and Agama texts explain Angikas and Mudras in detail.</p>
              <p>Each mudra (hand gesture), posture, and facial expression transforms the body into a precise instrument for articulating a vast spectrum of 'भाव'.</p>
              <p>These movements help standardize how bhava is shown and interpreted, making it easier for viewers to understand what is being communicated through body language. </p>
              <p><strong>Nonsystematic Movements:</strong> These pertain to quotidian body language, encompassing subtle postural adjustments, spontaneous actions, and general bodily movements that instinctively communicate an individual's internal state. Many of the systematic movements we do use in our daily life to express our intentions and emotions.</p>
              <p><strong>Sight:</strong> It is a key way to express our intentions and emotions. In fact, it is a component of earlier elements as well. His eyesight conveys the truth, despite the fact that he speaks lies. It is explained in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata.</p>

    "environment-details": {
      title: "2. Environment",
      content: `
              <p>The environment and surrounding contexts significantly shape how intention is manifested and perceived. At times, the environment itself communicates intent without the need for words or gestures.</p>
              <p><strong>Situation/Surroundings:</strong> The broader context and setting can express intention directly. For instance, a decorated home conveys welcome, while a neglected space can communicate indifference.</p>
              <p><strong>Subtle Elements (Tanmatras):</strong> When a person wants to express their intention using tanmatras (sound, touch, form, taste, and smell), these serve as the tools for that expression.</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Sound (Śabda):</strong> A soothing tune or a harsh noise expresses care or aggression (we discuss these in detail).</li>
                  <li><strong>Smell (Gandha):</strong> The fragrance of incense or flowers communicates purity, devotion, or welcome, whereas foul odors indicate rejection or neglect.</li>
                  <li><strong>Taste (Rasa):</strong> Sweet offerings may express affection; bitterness or refusal to share food can express hostility.</li>
                  <li><strong>Touch (Sparśa):</strong> A breeze or a comfortable seat conveys ease and concern, while a rough or harsh texture may indicate disregard.</li>
                  <li><strong>Color (Rūpa):</strong> Bright colors can convey happiness or celebration, while dark colors can convey fear, secrecy, or solemnity.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Silence:</strong> 'Silence' too is an autonomous expression. Pauses, stillness, or absence of sound can indicate agreement, rejection, tension, or deep thought.</p>

    "sound-details": {
      title: "3. Sound",
      content: `
              <p>Sounds are an incredibly powerful and versatile medium for expressing intentions, allowing individuals to convey their underlying purposes, aims, or desired outcomes. This can be majorly divided into Linguistic sounds and Non-Linguistic  sounds.</p>
              <p><strong>Linguistic sounds:</strong> When a speaker articulates a sound that has meaning for the whole sound. The listener can decode that meaning using his innate cognitive abilities. This is an  inherited ability of most of the creatures. All natural languages have linguistic sound and meaning. </p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Natural Languages:</strong> All natural languages are very effective in terms of expressing intention. There are around 7000 languages, and all of them are capable of being used for communication effectively.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Interestingly, there are some languages where there is no sound. For example,</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Sign Languages:</strong> Sign languages have no sounds, as natural languages have. But apart from that, all other components and compatibilities are seen. </li>
                  <li><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Sign languages have no sounds, as natural languages have. But apart from that, all other components and compatibilities are seen. </li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Non-Linguistic sounds:</strong></p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Natural sounds:</strong> Natural sounds like waterfalls, winds, breezes, and so on produce some sounds; it is not possible to understand them.</li>
                  <li><strong>Instrumental Music:</strong> On the other hand, instruments also produce the sound, but it is not much impossible to understand the intention of the instrument player.</li>
              </ul>
              <p><strong>Literature:</strong> Humans are often not satisfied with simple communication. They want to convey a greater depth of emotion and subtlety to the listener. For this purpose, they employ Literature — an artistic use of language that goes beyond simple exchange and touches the heart and even the Ātman. </p>
              <p><strong>Saṅgītam:</strong> At times, emotions are so powerful that even literature seems insufficient. To express the utmost depths of feeling and intention, humans use Saṅgītam. This unites instrumental music, vocal music, and dance, creating a multidimensional expression of bhāva. </p>

    "symbol-details": {
      title: "4. Symbol",
      content: `
              <p>Symbol is a profound and abstract medium for expressing 'भाव' (intention). Symbols are everywhere in the world. These are two types: natural, and some are artificial. </p>
              <p><strong>Natural symbols:</strong> Natural symbols are everywhere around us. They convey some intention, like thunder sounds. Many times, it is very difficult to understand them.</p>
              <p><strong>Artificial symbols</strong> are mostly human-created to specify some special meaning, such as traffic symbols.</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Numbers:</strong> Mostly, humans use numbers to express the count, volume, value, and size of anything. Through numbers, he expresses our intentions precisely, without any ambiguity. Many branches of mathematics deal with the same. </li>
                  <li><strong>Letters:</strong> 'Letters' are the symbols for representing of lingual sounds. We express our intention with them also. We use the term 'script' to refer to the same. Some languages do not have any script. Some languages have multiple scripts. </li>
                  <li><strong>Shapes/symbols:</strong> Shapes/symbols also explain the intention effectively in many scenarios. Special shapes, like the ‘swastika,’ have more significance in many societies. In fact, these convey the meaning easily. Additionally, it is very easy to remember. So many companies place greater importance on symbols and logos.</li>
                  <li><strong>Pictures/Videos:</strong> Nowadays, people are using this way to convey their intentions. This method is more attractive and efficient as well. </li>
                  <li><strong>Combination of Many Symbols:</strong> Sometimes, deeper and complex ‘intention’ cannot be expressed by any one type of symbol. So, humans started using the combination of symbols to express the complex and deep intention precisely. Many branches of mathematics do use the combination of symbols like ‘numbers,’ ‘letters,’ ‘shapes,’ and ‘symbols’ as well.  </li>
